This plugin was made for the Minecraft server Astra and access to others is granted through the current project license.

The purpose of this plugin is to unlock a skill-tree ability via command.

``Command Usage: /rpgst <player> <skillTreeNodeId> <level>``

The arg SkillTreeNodeId refers to the following:
![sample](https://github.com/Pryzinho/MMOCoreAstraAddon/assets/62448318/30f29048-4af5-4cb3-b272-8e5a26960dd6)

In this example the SkillTreeNodeId would be a1, then the command will be:
``/rpgst Pryzinho a1 1``

This will set the tree node level to 1.

**PSA: This command does not differentiate between skill trees, so make sure the SkillTreeNodeId is unique among all existing skill trees. Having more than one node with the same name, even if it's in different skill trees, will cause an issue.**
